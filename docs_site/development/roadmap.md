- ✅ Parameter matching with fuzzy search
- ✅ Boundary validation with literature citations

## Completed Phases

| Phase | Specialty | Calculators |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 1-15 | Core specialties | 75 |
| 16-19 | Extended coverage | 8 |
| 20-23 | Oncology, Rheumatology | 11 |

## Planned Features

### 2026 Q1
- [ ] Clinical Knowledge Graph (tool relationships)
- [ ] PyPI package release
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment templates

### 2026 Q2
- [ ] Documentation site (you're looking at the preview!)
- [ ] i18n expansion (zh-CN, ja)
- [ ] More calculators (Ophthalmology, Rheumatology extended)

### 2026 Q3

## Research Direction

We're developing an academic framework:

> *"Medical-Calc-MCP: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Reliable Clinical Reasoning"*

Key contributions:
1. **Clinical Knowledge Graph**: Tool relationship hypergraph
2. **Parameter Slot Filling**: Semantic entity alignment ✅
3. **Literature-Based Constraints**: Evidence-based guardrails ✅
